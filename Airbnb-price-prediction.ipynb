    "- Advertised price is set by the listing owner and can be any amount. This is the price that you see on Airbnb if you don't enter dates. The sensible option is to set it at the lowest possible price that your property is actually listed at, in order to entice more customers in. However, a lot of people do not know how to set up Airbnb listings well, and so this is sometimes also set at very high values.\n",
    "- This dataset can be used as a proof of concept. A more accurate version could be built using data on the actual average nightly rates paid, e.g. from sites like AirDNA."

Therefore this section of the dataset consists primarily of properties which have not yet had a completed stay (most likely properties which have not yet had a booking, although may also include properties that have a booking currently occuring). Although this is a considerable proportion of the dataset, these listings will be retained in the data because they are still legitimate properties with advertised prices, and are still part of the comparative market when considering the price for which to advertise your Airbnb listing.

These are properties which have been speculatively listed on Airbnb but either have their calendars closed (so no stays can be booked), or have prices which are notably higher than other properties in their area. The latter occurs in some cases when people who regularly live in a property put their property on Airbnb at a high price just to see if anyone is willing to book at that price (some Airbnb listings are indeed booked at very high prices). Then if their property is booked, they will decamp to a cheaper hotel for those dates, and pocket the difference in price.\n",
